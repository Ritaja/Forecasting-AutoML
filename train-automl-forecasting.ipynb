    "**Requirements** - In order to benefit from this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "- A basic understanding of Machine Learning\n",
    "- An Azure account with an active subscription. \n",
    "- An Azure ML workspace. \n",
    "- A Compute Cluster. \n",
    "- A python environment\n",
    "- Installation instructions \n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, you will need a [Compute Instance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-compute-instance) if you want to run this notebook directly within your Azure ML Studio as notebook (a Compute Cluster cannot be used here. Learn more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-compute-target#azure-machine-learning-compute-managed)). Also in that case you can set up a [Idle shutdown](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-manage-compute-instance?tabs=python#enable-idle-shutdown-preview) (a preview feature) to save cost of this compute instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivations** - This notebook explains how to setup and run an AutoML forecasting job. This is one of the [nine ML-tasks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml#when-to-use-automl-classification-regression-forecasting-computer-vision--nlp) supported by AutoML. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we use the associated Github DAU (Daily Active Users) dataset to showcase how you can use AutoML Deep Learning forecasts for a forecasting problem and explore the results. The goal is predict the users for the next 14 days based on historic time-series data."
